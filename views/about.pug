            | Hello! Thank you for viewing my project portfolio. My name is Zach and as you can see, I've made the decision to become a web developer. Despite not having a tech background, I have a diverse skillset thanks to my previous professional career.. 
            | My experience as a leader in both the US Army and private sector taught me how to problem solve, which is unquestionably crucial for any developer. I firmly believe my ability to solve complex problems will benefit your company.
            | In addition to being a leader, I've also been a strong proponent of peer collaboration and teamwork. Web development in 2020 is a team sport, and I'm certain I can be a key contributor to any project.
