### How to Use

This is a portfolio site that showcases all of my previous JavaScript projects. By clicking on a project, a page is dynamically generated that shows additional photos of the project as well as links to a live version of each project as well as its GitHub repository. On the landing page, users can click "learn more" in the left sidebar to show additional information about myself such as previous accomplishments, skills, and contact information. This project forms a solid foundation for any junior developer that wants to consolidate all of their accomplishments in one location.
